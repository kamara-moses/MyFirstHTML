        <li>Prepare the vegetables that you want to add to your sandwich. Tomatoes and lettuce are common vegetables
            added to sandwiches. Rinse all vegetables with clean water and dry them with a paper towel. Slice tomatoes
            and any other veggies that need slicing.</li>
        <li>Gather the materials needed on a flat ,clean, and sanitary surface. Take out two slices of your favorite
            bread. Some of the most common types of bread are white, wheat, sourdough, multigrain, etcâ€¦.</li>
        <li>Open your favorite condiment jar. Insert spreading knife into the jar and load the desired amount of
            condiment onto knife. Then spread condiment evenly onto one side of a sliced piece of bread. You can repeat
            this step for any additional condiments that you wish to eat. You can mix some of the condiments together to
            try a variety of different flavors. Which condiments you put on your sandwich is only limited by your
            imagination.</li>
        <li>Choose your favorite meat(s) and place onto one of the pieces of bread on the side with the condiment. Make
            sure to spread the meat in a way will go all the way to the edge of the bread. If your meat is round, you
            can slice the meat in half and place the straight edges along different sides of the piece of bread. This
            will allow you to enjoy the desired meat flavor with every bite of your sandwich.</li>
        <li>Place your desired amount of the cheese you have chosen on top of the meat. Make sure add enough cheese to
            cover the entire sandwich.</li>
        <li>Place the desired toppings (sliced tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, etc.) on top of your cheese.</li>
        <li>Place the second slice of bread with the condiment covered side down on top of your toppings.</li>
        <li>If desired, slice sandwich into a shape that will make it easier to handle. Some common shapes are
            rectangles where you cut the sandwich down middle or triangles in which you cut the sandwich diagonally
            through the middle. You may also cut it into decorative shapes like stars or hearts if you are feeling
            imaginative.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy your sandwich.</li>
        <li>If your sandwich is too dry try removing one of the slices of bread and spreading more condiments on it. You
            may also try adding tomatoes or pickles to moisten your sandwich.</li>
